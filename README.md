# Jagger's Gaming App

2024 v1.1

About

The app will be designed to help the user keep track of different aspects of their gaming such as:

    - Games currently being played
    - Games the user wishes to play
    - Individual game progress (% completion and/or achievements earned)

I plan to also include these special features:

    - Ability to add custom notes for games
    - Section for custom goals

I aspire to add more than listed, but I will not bite off more than I can chew for now.
